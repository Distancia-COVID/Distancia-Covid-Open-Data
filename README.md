Distancia-Covid Contact Estimates for Spain

Estimates of age-specific contact patterns in Spain during the Covid-19 pandemic. This data was generated from the CSIC Distancia-Covid survey (https://distancia-covid.csic.es/). It includes estimated mean numbers of coresidents and non-coresident contacts by age group during 2020 and 2021.

See `data/distancia_covid_contact_estimates_spain_metadata_dictionary.csv` for variable descriptions.

This data was generated from the survey implemented through the project "Impacto de las medidas de distanciamiento social sobre la expansión de la epidemia de Covid-19 en España," funded by the Spanish National Research Council (Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas, CSIC). Processing and analysis was done with support from the Human-Mosquito Interaction Project (H-MIP) funded by European Research Council Starting Grant No. 853271, and the Versatile emerging infectious disease observatory (VEO) funded by the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No. 874735.
